<p> We studied 3 different websites, The BRSD website, The Yale Art website, and the TSA website. The BRSD website is simple enough to find what you're looking for, although it can be a bit confusing at first.
The Yale Art website was a complete mess with stuff all over the place and nobody could find what they were looking for. The TSA website was straightforward, making it easy to find you're looking for.
Overall, the best website was the TSA website, followed by the BRSD website, followed by the Yale Art website. </p>
